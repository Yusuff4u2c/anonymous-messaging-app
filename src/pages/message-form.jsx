              Guide to write perfect Anonymous Messages by Kubool: With the help
              of our anonymous message sender named Kubool now, you can easily
              message your heart's desire to your friends, family members, and
              anyone you know who are on Kubool. We care about our users and
              thus we are suggesting what you may choose to tell them
              anonymously. Everyone in this world loves to get affection from
              their loved ones be it their parents, partners, or close friends.
              Tell them how much they matter to you and how much you care for
              them! These compliments will increase their positive feelings and
              they will feel your friendly love from the core of their heart. If
              you feel like there is something you do not like out of them, you
              may choose to constructively criticize them about it. That is
              completely fine and in fact when constructive criticism is
              delivered right, one can develop themselves accordingly to become
              a better person as a whole. Make sure to be on point with the
              criticism and make sure that it does not become an insult at the
              end. You may also choose to suggest things that will help them
              become a better person as a whole! Future predictions are tough,
              as shown by the available future predictions apps just like the
              love predictions! No one knows what is going to happen next. But,
              it is always good to be aware of your cons, focuses on your pros,
              and transforming your cons to your pros. That is exactly what good
              constructive criticism helps you achieve! We hope you liked this
              little guide on how you can write better anonymous messages which
              are going to be very productive. Don't forget to play by the
              rules, keep it clean out there. üòâ
